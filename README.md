# ReduxSimpleStarter

Exercises from the Udemy course [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/). This repo contains my coursework based on the ReduxSimpleStarter supplied in course materials.

Each course section starts from the upstream repo master hence the branches for each project. Not many commits, just the completed code for each section.

### Deviations from the course

- Used public class fields rather than binding methods to 'this' ([jury is still out](https://medium.com/@charpeni/arrow-functions-in-class-properties-might-not-be-as-great-as-we-think-3b3551c440b1)).
- Separated out components from HOC containers - I prefer the separation and reduced noise.
- Did not use Lodash - the equivalent JS is trivial.

### Additional packages used in exercises
